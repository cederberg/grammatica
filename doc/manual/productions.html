    <h1>Grammatica Reference Manual</h1>


    <h2>Productions</h2>

    <p>The grammar productions are defined in EBNF. This is a common 
    notation for grammars, and is <a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/bnf.html">described
    elsewhere</a>. Please be aware of that the grammar files use 
    their own "dialect" of EBNF, explained below.</p>

    <p>Each production definition consists of a production name and a
    set of production alternatives. Each alternative in turn contains
    references to tokens or other productions. Self-referencing is
    also accepted. A simple example of a production definition is
    shown in the figure below.</p>

    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>Prod = "TokenString" OtherProd
     | TOKEN_NAME OtherProd ;</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong>
      A simple example production. This production contains
      two alternatives illustrating all the valid ways of referring
      to a token or a production.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the example above "=" is used for separating the production
    name from the definition, instead of the standard EBNF ":=". Also
    the definition must end with a ";" character. The production name
    follows the same restrictions as the token name, i.e. it may only
    contain characters from the set <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.</p>

    <p>The grammar files also allow some constructs that are not part
    of standard BNF or EBNF. In particular this include parenthesizing
    with the "{", "}", "[", and "]" characters. See the figure below
    for an example of this. Normal grouping with "(" and ")" is of 
    course also allowed.</p>

    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>Prod = "1"?
     | "2"*
     | "3"+
     | {"4"}
     | ["5"] ;</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong>
      An example of the accepted forms of grouping and
      repetitions allowed. The "?", "*", and "+" characters are
      allowed after productions, tokens or normal parenthesis. The 
      "<code>{...}</code>" parenthesis is a shortform for 
      "<code>(...)*</code>", and the "<code>[...]</code>" parenthesis
      is a shortform for "<code>(...)?</code>".</p>
    </div>

    <p>The EBNF dialect used in Grammatica currently does not allow
    <code>null</code> (i.e. empty) production alternatives. Instead,
    the same result can be obtained by making all references to the
    production optional with the <code>[...]</code> construct or
    similar.</p>
