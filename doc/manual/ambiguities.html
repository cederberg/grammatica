    <h2>Handling Ambiguities</h2>

    <p>Grammar ambiguities are points in the grammar where multiple
    alternatives conflict. As the parser is deterministic, a single 
    alternative must be chosen and grammar ambiguities are therefore 
    not allowed.</p>

    <p>By looking several tokens ahead, a parser is able to resolve
    some grammar ambiguities. The LL parser in Grammatica supports
    looking many tokens ahead. See the figure below for a simple
    example that can be resolved by looking more than one token
    ahead.</p>

    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>Prod = "a" "b"
     | "a" "c" ;</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong>
      A simple grammar ambiguity. This ambiguity cause
      problems for parsers with a single look-ahead token, but
      Grammatica can handle it by resorting to two look-ahead
      tokens.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unfortunately, most ambiguities are not as easy to resolve
    automatically as the one in the figure above. An infinite number
    of look-ahead tokens may for example not be enough if the
    collision can itself consist of an infinite number of tokens. In
    these cases, the grammar must be rewritten to remove the
    ambiguity. In the figure below one such ambiguity and a resolution
    is shown.</p>

    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>OldProd = "a"* "b"
        | "a"* "c" ;

NewProd = "a"* ProdTail ;

ProdTail = "b"
         | "c" ;</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong>
      An unresolvable grammar ambiguity and a refactored
      production. As the number of conflicting tokens is potentially
      infinite, this ambiguity cannot be resolved by the use of a 
      look-ahead parser. Instead the production must be split into
      two, as illustrated by <code>NewProd</code> and
      <code>ProdTail</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unresolvable ambiguities can also occur due to loops in the
    grammar, causing some token sequence to possibly be repeated
    infinitely. Some ambiguities are also caused by an optional
    reference conflicting with the next reference inside a production
    alternative. All these types of ambiguities are detected by
    Grammatica and reported to the user.</p>
