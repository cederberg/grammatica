    <h2>Error Recovery</h2>

    <p>Grammatica supports automatic recovery of both parse and
    analysis errors. Measures are also taken to reduce the number of
    dependency errors, i.e. errors caused by previously reported 
    errors. The automatic recovery is not perfect, however, so in 
    some circumstances errors are omitted or included, although they
    shouldn't have been.</p>
    
    <p>Unexpected character errors (i.e. lexical errors) are handled
    by reporting the error and ignoring the character. The parser 
    will also enter recovery mode, which means that no further errors
    will be reported until three tokens have been read correctly. In 
    practice, this means that only the first character in an 
    erroneous sequence will be reported, although all are ignored. In
    the figure below this is illustrated for a grammar file.</p>
    
    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>$@#!</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong>
      An erroneous character sequence for a grammar file. If
      this sequence occurs in a grammar file (uncommented), only the 
      '<code>$</code>' character will be reported. The remaining 
      characters are also erroneous, but the error messages for them
      will be supressed.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Unexpected token errors (i.e. syntax errors) are handled by
    reporting the error and ignoring tokens until a valid token is
    found. The parser also enters error recovery mode, as explained
    above. In the figure below the parser error recovery behaviour is
    illustrated.</p>
    
    
    <div class="figure">
        <pre>Prod = "one" &lt;&lt;.&gt;&gt; "two" ;</pre>
      
      <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong>
      An erroneous token in a grammar production. The 
      regular expression token <code>&lt;&lt;.&gt;&gt;</code> is not
      allowed inside a production, and will cause an error. The 
      parser will recover by ignoring all tokens until the 
      '<code>;</code>' character.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Analysis errors are only reported as long as the parser has
    not encountered a lexical or syntactical error. In fact, after 
    such an error has been encountered, no further calls to the 
    analyzer are made at all. All analyzer errors encountered during 
    parsing are reported, but when analyzing an existing parse tree 
    some filtering is attempted to avoid dependency errors.</p>

    <p>Due to the error recovery, care must be taken when 
    implementing an analyzer. The callback methods will be called
    even though previous callbacks may have failed. In particular,
    this means that child nodes may be absent or reordered, and node 
    values may be missing, making null pointer errors more probable. 
    Helper methods that perform the necessary null checking have 
    therefore been created in the base Analyzer class, and it is 
    strongly recommended to use them.</p>
