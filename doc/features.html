    <h1>Grammatica Features</h1>


    <h2>Existing Features</h2>

    <p>This is a summary of the features currently present in 
    Grammatica.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Standard grammar syntax definitions</strong><br/>
        The grammar files define the tokens with regular
        expressions, and the syntax with plain EBNF. It is also 
        possible to specify tokens as strings, avoiding escaping 
        of any special regular expression characters.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Clean &amp; reusable grammar files</strong><br/>
        No parser source code is present in the grammar files,
        providing a cleaner separation between the grammar and the
        parser. This means that the grammar files can be reused by 
        other applications.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Support for LL(k) grammars</strong><br/>
        LL grammars with various number of look-ahead tokens 
        are supported. There is no need to declare the number of
        look-ahead tokens needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Detailed error messages for generated parsers</strong><br/>
        Messages generated when an error is found always 
        describe the problem with all required details. In particular,
        the list of expected tokens is always presented.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Automatic error recovery</strong><br/>
        Error recovery is always attempted by the parsers
        generated, without any changes needed in the grammar 
        files. This makes generated parsers much more usable.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Analysis though callbacks or syntax trees</strong><br/>
        It is possible to parse the grammar either through 
        callbacks or by traversing the syntax tree. When using 
        callbacks, the syntax tree creation can be avoided.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Parser generation for C# and Java</strong><br/>
        Both C# and Java parsers can be generated from the same
        grammar file. Both parsers behave in the same way and have the
        same feature set, including the regular expression
        support.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Full Unicode and regular expression support</strong><br/>
        The generated parsers use the Java or .NET platform
        support for Unicode and regular expressions to provide
        optimal integration and compatibility.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Readable and commented output source code</strong><br/>
        The source code generated is fully readable, being
        correctly indented and commented.
      </li>
        
      <li>
        <strong>Run-time parser creation</strong><br/>
        With the Grammatica parser libraries, an ad-hoc parser
        can be created at run-time without the need for generating
        source code. This can be used for easier debugging of 
        grammars, or for creating parsers interactively.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Integration with Apache Ant</strong><br/>
        Apache Ant tasks are available, integrating Grammatica 
        with the standard build tool for Java developers.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>

    <p>No commitment has been made regarding which new features will
    be present in future releases. See the 
    <a href="bugs.html">TODO-list</a> for a the currently known 
    future improvements.</p>
