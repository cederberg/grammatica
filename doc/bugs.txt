GRAMMATICA TODO-LIST
====================

Known Issues
------------

  This is a list of the known issues as of the release of version 1.6 
  (2015-05-17). Please verify that any new problem found is not in 
  this list before sending a bug report.

    o Parser: Some grammar ambiguities may go undetected
      When the last element of an alternative is optional, some 
      ambiguities may go undetected. This is due to not properly 
      comparing the tokens in the optional element with the tokens 
      after the production. The ambiguious grammar A = B ["x"]; B = 
      "y" ["x"]; illustrates this. In some cases this may also lead 
      to parse errors as ambiguities have not been resolved with the 
      appropriate number of look-ahead tokens. This error is present 
      in all versions of Grammatica, but occurs infrequently. [Bug 
      #4117]


Suggested Improvements
----------------------

  This is a list of the currently known suggested improvements.

    o Grammar: Add support for modular grammars
      By allowing one grammar to reference another, it would be 
      possible to create more complex modular parsers. This feature 
      also requires support for modular tokenizers and parses, as 
      well as the generation of modular code. [Bug #3599]

    o Grammar: Add localization support
      This includes finding an architecture that works for grammar 
      files, making it possible to localize the error messages 
      without rewriting the grammar file. This architecture must 
      support different methods depending on generated source 
      (ResourceBundles in Java, Gnu Gettext in C & C++). [Bug #3600]

    o Grammar: Production representation should be improved
      The internal representation of a production makes it hard for 
      several alternatives to share a several left-hand side 
      elements. This may cause inherent ambiguities to be found, as 
      the number of look-ahead tokens needed to separate the 
      alternatives is infinite. If these alternatives could share the 
      first elements, this ambiguity would not require a rewrite of 
      the grammar. [Bug #4322]

    o Grammar: Identical productions should be unified
      Identical syntetic productions are not indentified as such. 
      Instead, a new syntetic production is added in each case. This 
      will cause problems for LR parsers, and is generally 
      inefficient. Identical syntetic productions should be unified. 
      [Bug #3602]

    o Tokenizer: Add support for modes
      When reading certain tokens the tokenizer should be able to 
      enter some kind of "mode", limiting the set of tokens that are 
      considered for a match. This is highly useful in some grammars, 
      where the token syntax isn't easily represented with regular 
      expressions. [Bug #3604]

    o Parser: Add support for LR grammars
      This probably means writing at least an LALR(1) parser, and 
      probably also some kind of LR(k) parser. [Bug #3606]

    o Parser: Add parsing through code callbacks
      This would allow more complex grammars to be parsed where some 
      productions cannot be expressed in EBNF. Instead a callback 
      method would be called to parse some specific productions. [Bug 
      #3607]

    o Analyzer: Allow node values propagating downwards
      Improve the analyzer framework to handle node values 
      propagating downwards or sideways in the tree as well. [Bug 
      #3608]

    o Code Generation: Support creation of a C parser
      This requires the writing of a C runtime library. [Bug #3609]

    o Code Generation: Support creation of a C++ parser
      This requires the writing of a C++ runtime library plus 
      appropriate code generation classes. [Bug #3610]

    o Error Handling: Add file reference in errors
      The exceptions could be extended with a file location object (a 
      file reference) to simplify the error handling when several 
      files are parsed. [Bug #4180]
