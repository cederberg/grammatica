GRAMMATICA FEATURES
===================

Existing Features
-----------------

  This is a summary of the features currently present in Grammatica.

    o Standard grammar syntax definitions
      The grammar files define the tokens with regular expressions, 
      and the syntax with plain EBNF. It is also possible to specify 
      tokens as strings, avoiding escaping of any special regular 
      expression characters.

    o Clean & reusable grammar files
      No parser source code is present in the grammar files, 
      providing a cleaner separation between the grammar and the 
      parser. This means that the grammar files can be reused by 
      other applications.

    o Support for LL(k) grammars
      LL grammars with various number of look-ahead tokens are 
      supported. There is no need to declare the number of look-ahead 
      tokens needed.

    o Detailed error messages for generated parsers
      Messages generated when an error is found always describe the 
      problem with all required details. In particular, the list of 
      expected tokens is always presented.

    o Automatic error recovery
      Error recovery is always attempted by the parsers generated, 
      without any changes needed in the grammar files. This makes 
      generated parsers much more usable.

    o Analysis though callbacks or syntax trees
      It is possible to parse the grammar either through callbacks or 
      by traversing the syntax tree. When using callbacks, the syntax 
      tree creation can be avoided.

    o Parser generation for C# and Java
      Both C# and Java parsers can be generated from the same grammar 
      file. Both parsers behave in the same way and have the same 
      feature set, including the regular expression support.

    o Full Unicode and regular expression support
      The generated parsers use the Java or .NET platform support for 
      Unicode and regular expressions to provide optimal integration 
      and compatibility.

    o Readable and commented output source code
      The source code generated is fully readable, being correctly 
      indented and commented.

    o Run-time parser creation
      With the Grammatica parser libraries, an ad-hoc parser can be 
      created at run-time without the need for generating source 
      code. This can be used for easier debugging of grammars, or for 
      creating parsers interactively.

    o Integration with Apache Ant
      Apache Ant tasks are available, integrating Grammatica with the 
      standard build tool for Java developers.


Upcoming Features
-----------------

  No commitment has been made regarding which new features will be 
  present in future releases. See the TODO-list (in bugs.txt) for a 
  the currently known future improvements.
